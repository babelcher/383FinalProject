## ECE 383 Persistence of Vision Clock

### Prelab

#### Introduction
I will create a Persistence of Vision Display in order to display a message or the time. It will consist of 7 LEDs spinning around in a circle fast enough to give the appearance that there is a message sitting still. A few problems that I came across already are wires getting twisted up so in order to combat that I will spin the entire FPGA on an electric motor.

#### Levels of Functionality
Required-Displays a message in one position.
B Functionality-Displays the time to the viewer.
A Functionality-Displays the time and a greeting message to the viewer.

#### Timeline
- Getting the hardware finalized and built-Lesson 35
- Lighting up the LEDs only for brief portion of the circle-Lesson 36
- Getting required functionality-Lesson 37
- B Functionality-Lesson 38
- A Functionality-Lesson 39

I will try to keep to this timeline so that I will be finished on Lesson 39 and ready to demo on Lesson 40.
